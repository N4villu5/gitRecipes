### Cheese:

[comment]: # (Exact cheese ratios need tuning)
* 8 oz. Wisconsin Brick Cheese
* 4 oz. Low Moisture Mozzarella 


## Preperation

### *Note:*
* For a very crispy bottom crust, it is recommended to let your oven preheat to 500 f° and allow enough time for a pizza stone to come to full temperature. Usually 30+ minutes. Put rack and pizza stone on the bottom shelf of the oven.

### Dough (2+ Hours):
* Combine and stir flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment.
* Add the water and mix on low speed until the dough comes together into a rough ball. 
* Once a rough ball is achieved turn off the mixer for 10 minutes to let the dough relax. 
* Mix the dough on Med-Low (30%-40% speed) for 10 minutes. Until smooth, silky and stretchy. 
* Remove dough hook, form dough into a tight ball, set in the bottom of the mixer bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
* *(Optional)* You can start steps 1 and 2 from assembly phase to strech and relax the dough in the pan while cooking the sauce. 

### Sauce (35 Mins):
* Heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering.
* Cook aromatics - garlic, oregano, pepper flakes - for 30s, until fragrant. 
* Add tomatos, garlic powder, onion powder, and sugar. (Optional MSG)
* Simmer for 30 minutes to reduce. Season with salt to taste. 

### Assembly: 
* Add 1-2 tablespoons olive oil to steel pizza pan, spread to cover the bottom. Add dough and roll it to coat with oil. 
* Press and stretch dough with fingers to flatten it out towards the edges. You may only be able to stretch it so much before a 15 minute break to let the dough relax. Continue working it after relaxing. Repeating if necessary.
* For Corners - pull from the center with your index and thumb out to the corner edge, stretching to form a point.
* Cover dough completely with sauce, leaving only a small gap between the edge of the pan. (1 generous ladle)
* Cut the brick cheese into small cubes, ~1/2 inch large
* Evenly distribute cubed brick cheese, there will be gaps. Be sure to put it all the way to the edge, touching the pan. This is what creates the crust.
* Add dried oregano and basil if desired, cover the pizza with the Mozzarella. 
* Place pan directly on pizza stone. Maximum contact for heat transfer will result in a cripsy bottom. 
* Cook for 12-14 minutes @ 500 f°, until the cheese crust is dark brown and caramelized.
